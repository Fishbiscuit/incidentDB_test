# incidentDB_test

The repository used to build the static site is on Github so people can contribute
The CI script provided by the circleci service which is free for one project will build the webpage and host it on Github.

## Why Github

* Provides mechanisms for dispute resolution and contribution of incidents
* Free hosting for open source
* Tools are continually built on Github that you could fork/ adapt to improve the incident DB

## Ops

1. Build the workflow
1. Build the requisite discussion platforms and community incentives (eg. badges)
1. Host bounties for people who report incidents/ help to maintain the page
1. Reserve the analysis/consulting services on the bcss page. This is also a restriction on Github as Github only hosts static pages
