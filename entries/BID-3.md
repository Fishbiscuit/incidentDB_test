## Description
"We've got into contact with exchanges and increased the confirmation count which reduces the risk of this attack temporarily, as we are currently investigating consensus-based strategies for increased protection against hashrate-driven / difficulty manipulation attacks. Some options that we are considering may include PoS ideas. Our 0.16 codebase is otherwise ready to go, so along with increased network protection will come great features such as native bech32. As our network protection features will likely mean a hard fork, we will continue to communicate throughout development to ensure that all core nodes, pools, exchanges and the entire community is ready to update when the time comes. In the meantime, we urge everyone to wait 100+ blocks before treating transactions as confirmed." [1]

"In the case of Litecoin Cash (LCC), the developers confirmed the attack. The number of required network confirmations increased to at least 100 after developers contacted exchanges. All other currencies suffering from a 51% attack took similar measures. Even so, it would be better if issues like these never occurred in the first place. Thankfully, it seems Litecoin Cash will not face long-term harm. The team is working on protecting against major hashrate spikes. Such an endeavor is often easier said than done. A hard fork of the code appears imminent due to network protection features. Developers have not confirmed a hard fork yet, but it is a definite possibility. The new codebase is ready to go and will include some key features as originally planned." [2]

"The alleged incident seems to have happened on May 30, when Russia-based cryptocurrency exchange YoBit realised it had recognized a 51 percent assault on the coin, which forked from litecoin (LTC) in February but has struggled to gain traction in the months since." [3]
